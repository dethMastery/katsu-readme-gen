This project is based on vanilla `express.js` if you want to selfhost just use `netlify` or `heroku` :D

## Usage

This project can fully build a markdown on its page only things you need to do is just fill the box and see the result :D

### if you need an SVG Image

All you need to do is just see an image tag in the 2nd or 3rd line which would be like this 

`<img src="http://readme.katsuragi.cyou/api/`==canvas==`/?gh=[ghUserName]&id=...">`

change the highlight to svg like this

`<img src="http://readme.katsuragi.cyou/api/`==svg==`/?gh=[ghUserName]&id=...">`

and yes you got your svg image :D
